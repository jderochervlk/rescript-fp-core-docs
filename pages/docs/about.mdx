# Overview
`rescript-fp-core` is an alternative to [rescript-core](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core).

`rescript-core` has [guiding principals](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core#guiding-principles) to make it align with JS apis as much as possible.
This makes it easy to pick up and use if you already know JavaScript and you want to continue to write code in a similar way.

`rescript-fp-core` has a different focus of embracing functional programming and only using safe JS apis that do not mutate data or cause side-effects.
This means there is more of a runtime cost using this library over core, but it does try to use zero-cost bindings as much as possible.

## Inspiration
`rescript-fp-core` is heavily inspired by [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/). 
It also draws inspiration from [monet.js](https://monet.github.io/monet.js/), [Crocks](https://crocks.dev/docs/getting-started.html), and [F#](https://fsharp.org/).
