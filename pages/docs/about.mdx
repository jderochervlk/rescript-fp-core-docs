# Overview
`rescript-fp-core` is an alternative to [rescript-core](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core).

`rescript-core` has [guiding principals](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-core#guiding-principles) to make it align with the JS apis as much as possible.
This makes it easy to pick up and use if you already know JavaScript and you want to continue to write code in a similar way.

`rescript-fp-core` has a different focus of embracing functional programming and not allowing all of the JS apis to be used,
such as mutating arrays. This has means that there is more of a runtime cost to using this library over core, but I try to create zero-cost bindings when I can.

## Core modules
Not all modules have been created from scratch and when it makes sense the modules from `rescript-core` are used here.
Huge thanks to all of the effort done on that library.
