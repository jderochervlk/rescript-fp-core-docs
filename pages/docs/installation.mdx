# Installation

Install the package.

```sh
npm i rescript-fp-core
```
Update your projects `bsconfig.json` file.
```json
{
    "bs-dependencies": [
        "rescript-fp-core"
    ],
    "bs-flags": [
       "-open FpCore" 
    ]
}
```

> Note: It is recommended to not use `rescript-fp-core` and `rescript-core` together. If you do find a need to have both libraries only open one in `bsconfig.json`.
