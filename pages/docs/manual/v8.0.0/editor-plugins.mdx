# Editor Plugins

**Note**: the editor plugins below work with the old `.re` and `.ml` syntax (plus highlighting support for the new syntax for VSCode, Atom and Sublime Text). The new `v8.2.0` introduced a new syntax and several changes that required new editor plugins, listed on the newer version of this page.

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode)
- [Atom](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/atom-ide-reason)
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-plus)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/sublime-reason)
- [IDEA](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reason-mode) (currently unmaintained)
