# Migrate to New Syntax

Starting from `v8.2.0`, BuckleScript and the JS part of Reason are now fused into the new ReScript. We've also introduced a new syntax similar to the old Reason syntax, but [tremendously improved](https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax).

The old ML and Reason syntax are still supported (see our support commitment [here](https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments)). The gist is: this is mostly just a rebranding and shouldn't affect your existing code much.

## Upgrade Your Codebase

There are lots of exciting improvements in the new syntax (features, speed, error messages, etc.). The upgrade is trivial, backward-compatible and can be done on a per-file basis:

- Upgrade your project to `bs-platform 8.2.0` or later.
- `node_modules/.bin/bsc -format MyFile.re > MyFile.res`

**That's it**! `MyFile.re` could be any `.re`, `.rei`, `.ml` and `.mli` file.

Enjoy the improved experience!

## Difference With Old Reason

- Complete removal of semicolon (you can still write them).
- No need for parentheses around `if`, `switch` and `try`.
- Type arguments: from `option(int)` to `option<int>`.
- Old interpolated string: from `{j|hello ${name}|j}` to `` j`hello ${name}` ``. Now with proper unicode support!
- New interpolated string: `` `hello world` ``. Also supports multiline and unicode. `"hello world"` string is now singleline.
- Polymorphic variants: from `` `red`` to `#red`.
- Arrays: from `[|1,2,3|]` to `[1,2,3]`. In JS, arrays are the right default.
- Lists: from `[1,2,3]` to `list[1,2,3]` (_8.1.1 update_: now it is `list{1, 2, 3}`). This ties with upcoming plans to access containers in a uniform way: `set[...]` and `map[...]`. Maybe temporary.
- Exception: from `try (compute()) { | Not_found => Js.log("oops")}` to `try compute() catch { | Not_found => Js.log("oops")}`.
- First class module: from `(module S: Student)` to `module(S: Student)`.
- No custom infix operator for now (including `mod`).
- Object access: from `settings##visible #= true` to `settings["visible"] = true`. Rejoice!
- Object: from `Js.t({"age": int})` to just `{"age": int}`. The `Js.t` part is now implicit.
- Attribute: from `[@bs.deriving accessors]` to `@bs.deriving(accessors)`. From `[%re bla]` to `%re(bla)`.
- Removed dereference syntax `result^`. Just use `result.contents`.
- `fun` pattern matching syntax removed.
- Type declaration is non-recursive by default, consistent with let bindings. To have recursive types, use `type rec myList<'a> = Nil | Cons('a, myList<'a>)`.
- Use any words, including reserved keywords, as your identifier name: `let \"try" = true`.
